# Mosaic creation through the stitching of aerial rectified images obtained from a moving vehicle

### Goal
The gol is mosaic creation through the stitching of aerial rectified images obtained from a moving vehicle.

### Dataset
Stuttgart of Kitti (https://cityscapes-dataset.com/downloads/), in particular leftImg8bit_demoVideo (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GrhTcMOxjPN-Ei-k9IoUW1TAGNXe-ktn).
You can put the frames to processing into the folder dataset.

### Pipeline
1. Cars detection
2. Rectification
3. Keypoints detections with SURF
4. Compute matrix Homography
5. Image warping
6. Overlap to mosaic creation

### To run
```
$ python3 car_detection.py
compute_bird_view.m
$ python3 create_submosaic.py
$ python3 merge_submosaic.py
```
